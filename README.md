Communication pattern:

GET [type] - waits to get number of heuristics of given type

USE 0 [id] - uses heuristic [id] of type 0 and place in at address 0

USE [type] [id] [address] - uses heuristc [id] of type [type] on data placed at [address]

MOVE [address_1] [address_2] - move data from [address_1] to [address_2]

By default recently created solution is placet at 0'th position in cache table
